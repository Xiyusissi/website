  	<h3> Engineer - Design Thinker - Innovator </h1>

  	<p> Hello! </p>

  	<p>I'm Cici, an engineer addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals with technology, business, and design. Currently, I am looking for a summer internship in corporate strategy, VC, or entrepreneurship where I can practice my business skills while advancing my mission.

  	<p> Right now, I am a first year joint degree student at Yale School of Management and Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies. I received my Bachelor of Science in Environmental Engineering from Yale College with a background in policy, design, data, and project management. </p>
